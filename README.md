# Mobile First Prototypes

Our mobile-first template is based on four breakpoints and uses the default grid from our Hoisin framework. 

# The Grid

The grid guidelines are present on page you add. You can toggle these on and off using 'CMD+.' on OS X or 'CTRL+.' on Windows. The grid values are explained in more detail for each breakpoint.

If you want to use your own grid then go to Arrange > Grid and Guides > Delete All Guides. You can the add your own grid guidelines from the “Create Guides” option also in that menu. You will need to add them individually for each breakpoint (remember to check “Create as global guides” so they appear on new pages). 

# The Breakpoints

## Smartphone

This is the Base view in our template and your starting point when wireframing. Any elements you add here will be carried across to other breakpoints where they can be reworked to better fit the additional space. 

### Grid
For this breakpoint there is one grid which is a single column layout. The column width is 300px and the margins on either side are 10px. 


## Tablet

This is the second view in our template. This view should contain all the elements from the Base view (smartphone). Any changes or additional elements you add to the elements here will only be reflected on the larger breakpoints (desktop and large desktop). It will not affect any elements in the Base view. 

### Grid
For this breakpoint there are two grid options, a two column layout and a three column layout. Do not use both grids together on a single page. Decide if this page best suits a two or three column layout and remove the guidelines that are not required. 


## Desktop

This is the third view in the template. This view should contain all the elements from the Tablet view. Any changes or additional elements you add to the elements here will only be reflected on the large desktop. It will not affect any elements in the Base view or Tablet view. 

### Grid
This breakpoint follows the classic 960 grid. There are 12 columns, each 60px wide. These are separated with 20px gutters and 10px margins on either side.


## Large Desktop

This is the fourth and final view in the template. This view should contain all the elements from the Desktop view. Any changes or additional elements you add to the elements here will only be reflected on this breakpoint. It will not affect any elements in the Base view, Tablet view or Desktop view.

### Grid
This breakpoint has 12 columns, each 70px wide. These are separated with 30px gutters and 15px margins on either side.
